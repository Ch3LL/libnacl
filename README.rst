==============
Python libnacl
==============

This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by
Daniel J. Bernstein's nacl library via libsodium or tweetnacl. It has
been constructed to maintain extensive documentation on how to use nacl
as well as being completely portable. The file in libnacl/__init__.py
can be pulled out and placed directly in any project to give a single file
binding to all of nacl.

Higher Level Classes
====================

The libnacl code also ships with many high level classes which make nacl
cryptography easy and safe, for documentation please see:
